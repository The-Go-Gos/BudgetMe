# BudgetMe

## PWA App for budgeting/spending

## Overview

Dashboard where a user can see how much they have spent in different categories that will use a receipt image or e-receipt

## MVP

* Users can take/upload a picture of a receipt through the app
* The app will detect the text on the receipt and parse out each item name and total
* User selects items/all and assigns them to categories
* We provide default categories in dropdown list that user can add to

## Stretch Goals

* Data visualization of monthly spending per category
* User can input overall budget for month - app notifies them when:
  Approaching/
  Meeting/
  Exceeding
* User can add customized category to the NavBar on dashboard page(add a column in category db)

#### What if I lose your receipt by accident? Or didn't get a receipt at the store? Don't worry, BudgetMe provides the ability to add costs manually so you don't miss out on every item.
