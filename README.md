# BudgetMe

## PWA App for budgeting/spending

### Overview
Dashboard where a user can see how much they have spent in different categories that will use a receipt image or e-receipt 
 
### MVP
- Users can take/upload a picture of a receipt through the app
- The app will detect the text on the receipt and parse out each item name and total
- User selects items/all and assigns them to categories
- We provide default categories in dropdown list that user can add to

### Stretch Goals
- Data visualization of monthly spending per category
- User can input overall budget for month - app notifies them when:
Approaching
Meeting
Exceeding 
- User can add customized category to the NavBar on dashboard page(add a column in category db)
